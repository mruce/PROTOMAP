### What is it?
**PROTOMAP** is an Auto-Calibration System for Projection Mapping.

### Well - what does it mean exactly?
First things first: <link rel="Projection Mapping" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Projection_mapping"> is a technique used to turn objects, often irregularly shaped, into a display surface for video projection. It means it can transform a physical object into a projection canvas and put life into it.
Creating Mapping installations is hard - not only it requires artistic skills, but also tools and technical knowledge. **PROTOMAP** aims to solve most painful technical difficulties in the process, lowering the threshold for creators.
Specifically - using **PROTOMAP**, you don't need to worry about technical aspects and focus on creating beautiful content.

### But how does it work?
From the creator's point of view - you need to add webcams to your setup, run our software - and wait for calibration.
Right now **PROTOMAP** works with Unity - which means you can create a 3D scene based on a model you're displaying on, place projectors and cameras - and run **PROTOMAP**. That's when magic happens.

More technically - calibration is a three-step process:
- Structured Light is used to match points on different projectors and cameras
- Cameras' and  projectors' optical and geometrical parameters are obtained using Genetic algorithm
- 3D model's scale, position and rotation parameters are obtained using Genetic algorithm

Then, calibration is applied to the scene - and the show can go on.


### Right - but why would I want to use it?
There are two main benefits of using **PROTOMAP**:
1. You don’t need to worry about technical aspects of Projection Mapping to achieve great precision. It means, of course, that creating Mapping installation is getting cheaper - as you don’t need highly qualified staff to make it work
2. Even slight rearrangement of projectors makes installation look really bad - and it happens rather often. Because Calibration is now automatic, it can be fixed remotely, very fast. That's a great thing on it’s own - but we believe that it’s even more important: it makes it possible to use Mapping in contexts that were not feasible previously - for example it can be used in retail, in multiple locations at a time - without an army of staff to manage it. Scale up!
