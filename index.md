# What is it?
PROTOMAP is an Auto-Calibration System for Projection Mapping.

# Well - what does it mean exactly?
First things first: Projection Mapping is a technique used to turn objects, often irregularly shaped, into a display surface for video projection. It means it can transform a physical object into a projection canvas and put life into it.
Creating Mapping installations is hard - not only it requires artistic skills, but also tools and technical knowledge. PROTOMAP aims to solve most painful technical difficulties in the proces, lowering the threshold for creators.
Specifically - using PROTOMAP, you don't need to worry about technical aspects and focus on creating beautiful content.

# But how does it work?
From the creator point of view - you need to add webcams to your setup, run our software - and wait for calibration.
Right now Protomap works with Unity - which means you can create a 3D scene based on a model you're displaying on, place projectors and cameras - and run PROTOMAP. That's when magic happens.

More technically - calibration is a three-step process:
Structured Light is used to match points on different projectors and cameras
Cameras and  projectors optical and geometrical parameters are obtained using Genetic algorithm
3D model's scale, position and rotation parameters are obtained using Genetic algorithm

Then, calibration is applied to the scene - and the show can go on.


# Right - but why would I use it?
There are two main benefits of using PROTOMAP:
You don’t need to worry about technical aspects of Projection Mapping to achieve great precision. It means, of course, that creating Mapping installation is getting cheaper - as you don’t need highly qualified stuff to make it work
Even slight rearrangement of projectors makes installation look really bad - and it happens rather often. Because Calibration is now automatic, it can be fixed remotely, very fast. That's a great thing on it’s own - but we believe that it’s even more important: it makes it possible to use Mapping in contexts that were not feasible previously - for example it can be used in retail, in multiple locations at time - without an army of staff to manage it. Scale up!
